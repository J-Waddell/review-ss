I purchased this product to help me quit and so far it has been a great tool in the process. I feel comfortable and confident using monq because I understand what it is I am putting into my body and honestly do feel the stress reducing benefits. Monq has really helped me to reduce the cigarette cravings from an habitual aspect. I still go outside a few times a day but instead of smoking I use my monq and I feel satisfied enough to fight the urge to smoke. The relaxation of the aromatherapy is great and I know this product will become a device in my everyday life long after it helps me kick my nasty smoking habit.",

What I did notice was an overall change in my attitude. I think for me the essential oils played a significant role in my behavior so long as they were still in my system. A couple of puffs in the morning, a couple at night, and mine lasted a month! \n \nAgain, this is not what I was expecting, however I experimented and found a method that really worked for me. \n \nIf you're like me don't expect some ah ha moment when you use this product.

I figured I would use it before my workout tonight. I agree with the other reviewers who stated that the price is a bit high. It could be really great if there could be a less disposable option, or if these were a bit cheaper. I would love to continue buying them, but I don't think my wallet would approve of that.

Not only with the idea (as you are the only kind of this in the market), but the colors, the light up crystal at the of the stick. I like the lifestyle marketing as well. This is not a \"smoking\" item...it's lifestyle item and I really want to include a MONQ in our GoddessProvisions.com box. I had reached out a few months ago about a partnership and it didn't work at the time. After all of us at MONQ and our friends tried...there's no doubt that we need to partner.

I've been looking for little things to help bring more positive and happy vibes into my life. When I read about Monq, I really wanted to try one and see if it works like described. So I got the Vibrant diffuser as my first test and I couldn't be more pleased. As soon as you open the package you can smell the lemon and spearmint. Not to mention for a first time user it was extremely easy to use. And the flavor/smell is wonderful. It leaves a nice hint of mint on your tongue and the smell of it as I exhale perks me right up. I carry it around with me everywhere I go and use it periodically throughout the day. \n\nI'm really happy to have found Monq and I can't wait to try all the other diffusers. That's literally the only problem I've had with Monq so far. The fact that I want more, if not all, of their products immediately!

I'm incredibly conscientious about what I put in and on my body, avoiding anything with potentially harmful chemicals or processing. I was afraid it might have an artificial taste, but that was not the case at all. It's like a delicious herbal tea in a vapor. When it says orange, frankincense and ylang-ylang, it actually tastes like those fresh herbs and flavors and not artificial versions. This particular blend really helped calm me when life stresses became a bit too much. It instantly slowed me down, cleared my head, and gave me a sense of calm. It was not habit forming - I used it as needed but never felt \"addicted\" or had cravings. It has same effects as a potent cup of relaxing herbal tea, or an aromatherapy diffuser with essential oils. But you can get those benefits in an instant, and on the go!

Being a Vape user for the past 2 years I have unfortunately become addicted to the routine of puffing on my flavored nicotine all day. I have an idea for you guys...it would be awesome if y'all created a blend that helped with the effects of nicotine cravings, I know grapefruit oil has been used to help people quit cigarettes!

I have very painful bladder ulcers and colitis. Needless to say, using the bathroom is never fun for me and I have to do it A LOT while working 30-35 hours a week. Most people with my condition are on disability. I am trying to get a better diet down and I have been very sick recently from the aggressive treatments. Within the first few days of using the Healthy Monq, my stomach has felt so much less upset all of the time, which means my bladder spasms less. I kind of have a distaste for junk food now, and that says a lot because I will eat anything that looks good and I'm always hungry because my disease makes me crave carbs horribly. I can't drink caffeine, which also sucks because I used to survive off of it and I get little to no sleep, but I have slept well and been more energized. Although it doesn't relieve too much pain that is already there, which I didn't expect it to at all, it helps with the symptoms that make it worse. I have also found it helps headaches.",

I purchased all seven varieties, and being a woman of many moods, I get regular use out of all of them. You only need a couple very light puffs to get maximum benefits. If you wish to take more than a couple light puffs at one sitting I do recommend waiting a couple minutes to let the vape cool down. If the vape gets to warm it will toast the oils and ruin the refreshing natural flavors. This will also cause your vape to not last as long. I recieved my order around a month ago and have not ran out of any varieties. My favorite flavor is ZEN MONQ, and I feel the most effects from the SLEEPY MONQ. I take a couple deep light breathes from SLEEPY MONQ in through my mouth and out through my nose before bed. It is the perfect sober way to unwind after a long day and ensure a solid night of sleep. Then I wake up wide-eyed and bushy tailed the next morning. \nThank you MONQ for making products to support a healthy and mindful lifestyle!",

I don't really trust traditional, nicotine \"vapes\" because I'm not convinced that they are not just as harmful as cigarettes so I was attempting to quit just ween myself off but I still found myself craving something that would appease that hand to mouth habit. Then I stumbled upon Monq and my life has completely changed. What drew me to the product was the fact that it is a completely natural product. Everything you are inhaling is from the earth and that is number one for me at this point in my life. I'm trying to eliminate all toxins so the fact that I can replace one of the worst toxins I am putting in my body with something completely natural is amazing to me. I'm so grateful I found Monq and have no doubt I will be a lifetime user. Everywhere I go I tell everyone I know about them and how much they changed my life. Even for non-cigarette users, the blends do what they say they do. I shared a few puffs of Zen with my father who suffers from mild anxiety and he said it truly eased his mind and I personally swear by Sleepy and Happy. I received mine order about a month ago now and have not run out of any blend too, so I am very impressed by their longevity too! All in all an amazing product and I will preach its benefits for life!",

Zen, Sleepy and Sexy help me relax (they each help me relax in slightly different ways), Active and Vibrant seem to make me feel more alert. \n \nHealthy MONQ has probably been the most beneficial for me. I have problems with sinus pain and pressure, especially in the summer time, and I happened to be using my Healthy MONQ right as I was getting piercing pain in my head. Within 3-5 minutes I noticed the pressure was still there, but the pain was gone. When it happened again a few days later, I grabbed my Healthy MONQ and it worked again. I certainly wasn't expecting it to do that! Now, every time I feel that sharp pain, I go straight to my MONQ and it usually takes care of the pain. I am so happy, it has helped me cut down on so much sinus pain/pressure reliever medication. \n \nI didn't expect to write this long of a review, but I am very happy with MONQ! It is worth trying!",

Having a stressful job, being a mom, & a wife, I really didn't want to try pharmaceuticals, so when I heard about the company I thought I would give it a go. I am so glad I did, I usually take 2-3 drags before bed and it puts me into a wonderful Zen (LOL) like sleep mode. I have had the best sleep in a long time!

Also because apart from the disclaimer on the Store Website itself, I couldn't really find any other data concerning possible health issues with vaping essential oils through glycerine. However as I dug into the science a bit more, I found out that the effect of using Monq is actually comparable to smelling at any stationary oil diffusor used in living rooms and toilets all around the place. This pretty much lowered my concerns enough to actually try it out. And I am very happy with it. \n \nI don't know if it's just placebo but I actually also don't really care because the smell and taste of the MONQ is just amazing. I used the happy MONQ and it created a calm, relaxing atmosphere right from the first puff! Also I felt my heartrate going down a bit and my whole body just seemed to relax and feel \"at home\".

As a strict non-smoker coming from a family full of them I have been sceptical of the \"smoking\" aspect all together. I love the calming experience derived from drawing in the \"smoke\" and the sight as I exhale. That added with the scent is what I think helps to relax me. Love the orange after taste. However I found the taste to be somewhat unpleasant when inhaling. I choose to draw in and exhale through my nose. All together I love it. Will be trying healthy and vibrant next!",

The vapor does not have any \"intoxicating\" effect, but does have a nice taste, smell and a smooth feeling in the mouth/nose. I generally don't inhale, instead I puff on it like a cigar, drawing vapor into just my mouth then exhaling through my nose. (Or sometime I French inhale) \nOne thing that surprised me was the cute rhinestone on the end that lights up pretty colors when you pull. I love it, but if I were a masculine dude I might not like it much... Manly men might want a nice aromatherapy vape too! The pens do have a nice grippy yet smooth feel to them. \n \nAnyways, overall a very cool product. They offer free shipping on orders over $60, which means buying at least 3 pens, so I'm glad there are so many flavors to choose from. \n \nIn the future I hope to see bottles of the vape liquid available for sale, that way I don't end up throwing away a ton of \"disposable\" pens over time. \n \nThanks MONQ!",

My boyfriend and I ordered the zen and the sleepy monq. The zen has a pleasant flowery orange scent that is very calming, left a smile on my face every time I could return to a little puff here and there. The sleepy has a nice manly woodsy scent that at some point smells kind of like fruit loops, also very relaxing. I loved this product because its aromatherapy and has no nicotine, chemicals, or tobacco. I'm not a smoker but I have anxiety and don't want medication to calm me down. Sometimes I'm a little stressed, so a little pick me up puff does just the trick. I highly recommend this product! However I hope that soon in the future this company makes a refillable cartridge because this is \"addicting\" in a fun way;) I love my monq!",

I got the happy Monq and zen Monq. The happy Monq does help boost your mood if you're feeling a bit under. And the zen one helps with stress and anxiety along with helping migraine relief. I would sit in yoga position and do slow breathing methods along with inhaling the zen pen slowly three times in between. My tense migraines would mostly go away.

While we still don’t use them in public, we very much enjoy MONQ. \nMy caveats are: \nThe marketing is a bit off - not sure who the product is intended for. The video I saw looked like it was directed at sullen hipster millennials. \nThe taste can occasionally be a little sour - this could be related to hot weather or other foods I have recently eaten, etc. Just want to make sure I don’t need to keep them refrigerated or something to keep the oils fresh? \nFinally, for both of us, the effects are really quite subtle. Other than the Sleepy mix, I’m not sure if I have noticed much of a feeling from any of them. \nRegardless, they all smell amazing and are refreshing to use. Will most likely buy a few more after these run out. \nThanks!",

I've never been about essential oils nor did I know the effects that came with it. With being an \"essential oil virgin\", I decided to buy 1 vibrant Monq to figure out what the hype was about. I have a baby on the way and have just moved across the country, and with these life changes came a lot of stress and anxiety. Vibrant Monq put my anxiety at bay. I can't really describe the feeling, but my coworkers can definitely see a change as far as my mental mood. \n\nThe flavor of the vibrant is OUTSTANDING. The most noticeable flavor of the 3 is definitely the ginger. However, the aftertaste seems to shine the spearmint/lemon more. Shipping was really fast, I ordered Friday and got it in Tuesday. Monq is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to anyone.",

I have anxiety and panic attacks and to top it off I just recently got hearing aids which is extremely overwhelming sometimes, so when I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed I just take a few puffs of the Zen and I'm back to my usual happy self. I love how relaxing it is, even my boyfriend who has never believed in essential oils absolutely loves the Zen and now has got himself one instead of always using mine. So if you are worried it's a waste of money have no more fears it's the best $20 you will spend if relaxing is your goal",

Lower the price a little and come out with fruit aromas and you could easily become huge in nightlife. Also you could curve the impact of Tabacco vaporizers",

Each one comes in a little tube labeled with the 3 scents and the desired 'effect' of them. Each Monq has a personality of its own, but the product line as a whole is designed to be sleek and sophisticated. It gives aromatherapy a modern and minimalist feel by taking out the difficulty of studying aromatherapy and allowing anyone to benefit from it. You don't have to be a professional in different smells or the effects of them; you simply have to know what you want to feel and/or what you want to smell. Monq does the rest of the work for you so you can breathe a little more easily. Out of the 7 current mixes my two favorites are the Zen Monq and the Active Monq. The Zen does wonders to relax me when I'm feeling anxious or overwhelmed while the Active has an awesome kick of black pepper that makes you a bit more alert.",
